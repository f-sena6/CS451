Purpose of my application:

The purpose of my application is to create a cipher using the python package “Pycrypto.” This implementation uses DES for encryption. The function I used encrypts the string, then decrypts it.

This program takes input that is entered in by the user and encrypts it. The DES function I used requires that the string entered is to be a multiple of 8. Since it is possible for a user to enter in a string that is not a multiple of 8, I used a for loop that would add in empty spaces until it was a multiple.

I decided to use a random number generator for the key in this implementation. I used a for loop to generate this key. The key must be 8 bytes long.
